# Predicting-Exam-Grade-using-Multimodal-Physiological-data
A Wearable Exam Stress Dataset for Predicting Cognitive Performance in Real-World Settings

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student exam grades and predicting final exam performance using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of student grades from multiple exams, and the goal is to build a predictive model to estimate final scores based on prior performance.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning using Pandas and NumPy.
- Machine learning model training using Scikit-Learn.
- Model evaluation and performance metrics.
- Integration with Google Colab for easy execution.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   [git clone https://github.com/SaiRam-Peruri/Predicting-Exam-Grade-using-Multimodal-Physiological-data.git]
   cd Predicting-Exam-Grade-using-Multimodal-Physiological-data
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook AI_Final_Project.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Train a machine learning model on student exam scores.
3. Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
4. Use the trained model to predict final exam scores.
